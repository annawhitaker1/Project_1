# Uber Trips Data Analysis Project 

Overview

  This project analyzes trends and patterns within an Uber trip data set to gain insights into rider volumes, driver growth, and the influcnce of various factors, like weather and day of the week. Our analyisis explores key questions around the growth of Uber drivers through 2 months, impacts of weather on ride volume, weekday and weekend trends, and how holidays effect ride volume.

Key Questions and Analysis 

  How did the number of Uber Drivers and associated trips evolve over the course of this data set? (Anna)
    - We created a scattered plot with a regression line and a bar chart to compare the trends in active vehicles and daily trip    volume. We found that the number of active Uber drivers increased over time, with trip volumes growing at an even faster rate. 
    
  What impact does weather have on Uber trip volumes, if any? (Axel)
  
    - We created 4 different scattered plots with regression lines comparing total trips with different weather variables. We found that the max temperature of each day had strongest correlation to the amount of total trips per day. As temprature increased, total amount of rides decreased. 
    
  Is there a difference in Uber ride volumes between weekdays vs weekends? Does higher precipitation impact that? (Rania)
  
    - We created a bar chart and line graph to compare the average number of trips on weekdays vs on weekends. We found that Uber trip volumes where consistently higher on weekends compared to weekdays. We also found that weekend days with precipitation showed higher trip volumes, while weekday trip volume were less impacted by rain.  
    
  Did the holidays in this data set have a positive or negative impact on uber trip volumes compared to non holiday days? (Oanh)
  
    - For this question we decided to create 3 bar charts comparing New Years Day, Valentines Day, and the rest average non-holiday days. We found that on New Years Day, there was significantly lower total amount of trips that day compared the the average day. And on Valentines day there was significantly higher total amount of trips that day compared the the average day.

Conclusion 

   In conclusion our analysis of Uber trip data revealed notable patterns in driver growth and fluctuations in total ride volumn due to many variables such as weather, day of the week, and holidays. We observed that while the number of active Uber drivers grew over time, the volume of daily trips increased at a faster rate. We also found that weekends consistantly saw higher trip volumes compared to weekdays. With the max temperature having a negative correlation with total trip volume. Lastly we found that holidays have an effect on total trip volume as well. These findings help us better understand how temporal factors and weather conditions can impact Uber demand.
